MOSP is a Python-based reimplementation of Minecraft 1.20.1 using Fabric. The original Java source code has been rewritten and refactored in Python, serving as a foundation for anyone looking to build a Minecraft-inspired game.

Note: This project is not playable. Rendering, graphics, and input handling are not implemented—only entities and core game logic exist. This is only a foundation.
